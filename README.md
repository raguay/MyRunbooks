# MyRunbooks

These are the Runbooks I've created for the fig
program. Fig is a terminal assistant that is
really nice!

Runbooks are made with Rundown, a combination of a 
markdown parser and a TIL scripting language. This 
allows for the creation of notebooks that run scripts 
in your current terminal.

## List of Runbooks:
